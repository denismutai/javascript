This repository is for practicing JavaScript Foundations
## JavaScript Variables
* Businessess and companies uses various data which may be of interest to web developers. Examples of data in a commerce company include customer name or customers online shopping cat
* To use the data in the web or software development process, they must be stored
* __Variables__ are named storage or containers used to store data
### Creating or declaring variables 
* Variables can be declared using three methods in JS
1. __const__: Has two use cases
* Declaring variables that are known prior to development and which one is absolutely sure a need to reassign them may not arise eg const yearOfBirth=1999; //in this case it is a sure thing that the year of birth won't change at any point and thus there will be no need to reassign it
* It is also used to declare variables that are hardcoded and and therefore not any chance that they will be reassigned. The justification for this use case is that it helps with values that may be difficult to remember in real time. In this case, the variables are declared using uppercase e.g 
    const RED= #07745FG
2. __let__- let is used to declare variables that can be changed at any point
    let currentYear = 2022;
* Variables can be declared and not assigned a value
* Example 
    let age;
* Variables can also be reassigned to be given another value
* Example 
    age =currentYear-yearOfBirth;
